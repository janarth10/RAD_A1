- To run the script use ruby s3706154_p2.rb -h to see how to pass arguments.

- For the flags always use two hyphens(EG: good: --xml emails.xml  bad: -xml emails.xml)

- Also when entering names with an apostrophe, prefix the apostrophe with a backslash(EG O\'Donnelly)

- flags can be entered in any order but "list" must be entered immediately after "ruby s3706154_p2.rb"
