- To run the script use ruby s3706154_p2.rb -h to see how to pass arguments.

- For the flags always use two hyphens(EG: good: --xml emails.xml  bad: -xml emails.xml)

- Also when entering names with an apostrophe, prefix the apostrophe with a backslash(EG O\'Donnelly)

- flags can be entered in any order but "list" must be entered immediately after "ruby s3706154_p2.rb"

Part 3:

- before/after flags must be given date in format "year-month-day", "year-month", "year"

- before/after flags are inclusive(EG: --before 2015 will return emails with send dates <= 2015)
